    "In data management, most of an enterprise’s relevant data is stored in an Oracle Database, in Microsoft SQL Server, or an IBM Db2. Although open-source databases are coming to the forefront, data integration tools that comprise extract, transform, and load (ETL) tools. According to a Gartner Magic Quadrant, Informatica PowerCenter and IBM InfoSphere DataStage are the leaders. These are followed by SAP, Oracle, SAS, Talend, and Microsoft products. These tools support the design and deployment of ETL data processing pipelines through a graphical interface. They bring along connectors to most of the commercial and open-source target information systems. Finally, Watson Studio Desktop includes a component called Data Refinery, which enables definition and execution of data integration processes in a spreadsheet-style .  data visualizations use business intelligence (BI) tools. The focus of these tools is to create visual reports and live dashboards. The most prominent commercial representatives are: Tableau, Microsoft Power BI, and IBM Cognos Analytics. Another type of visualization targets data scientists rather than end users. For example, the visualization can show relationships between different columns in a table. This functionality is contained in Watson Studio Desktop. If you want to build a machine learning model with a commercial tool, you should use a data mining product. The most prominent products in that space are: SPSS Modeler and SAS enterprise miner. In addition, SPSS Modeler is also available in Watson Studio Desktop, based on the tool’s cloud version.  Also, commercial software can export models in an open format. For example, SPSS Modeler supports exporting models as predictive model markup language (PMML), which an abundance of other commercial and open software packages can read. Model monitoring is a very new discipline. Currently, relevant commercial tools are not available. Therefore, open source is the first choice. The same is true for code asset management. Open source with Git and GitHub is the de facto standard. Watson Studio Desktop combines Jupyter Notebooks with graphical tools to maximize the performance of data scientists. Watson Studio, together with Watson Open Scale, is a fully integrated tool covering the data science life cycle involving all tasks discussed previously. Another example of a fully integrated commercial tool is H2O Driverless AI, which covers the complete data science life cycle.\n",

    "Watson Studio and Watson OpenScale cover the complete development life cycle for all data science, machine learning, and artificial intelligence (AI) tasks. Another example is Microsoft Azure Machine Learning. It is also a full cloud-hosted offering supporting the complete development life cycle of all data science, machine learning, and AI tasks. And finally, another example is H2O Driverless AI. Although it is a product you download and install, there exists a one-click deployment for the standard cloud service providers  the cloud provider operates the product by backing up your data and configuring and installing updates. Some proprietary tools are only available from a single cloud provider. One example of such a service is Amazon Web Services DynamoDB, which is a NoSQL database. It allows storage and retrieving data in a key-value or a document store format. The most prominent document data structure is JSON. Another flavor of such a service is Cloudant, which is a database as a service offering. But, in the background, it is based on the open-source Apache CouchDB IBM offers Db2 as a service as well. It is an example of a commercial database made available as a SaaS offering in the cloud. \n",
    "commercial data integration tools that include extract, transform, and load (ETL) tools and extract, load, and transform (ELT) tools. It means the transformation steps are not done by a data integration team but are pushed toward the domain of the data scientist or data engineer. Two commercial data integration tools widely used are Informatica Cloud Data Integration and IBM’s Data Refinery. Data Refinery is part of IBM Watson Studio. It allows transforming large amounts of raw data into consumable, quality information in a spreadsheet-like user interface.\n",
    "cloud data visualization tools is huge, and every major cloud vendor has one. An example of a smaller company offering a cloud-based data visualization tool is Datameer. IBM offers its famous Cognos Business intelligence suite as a cloud solution. IBM Data Refinery also offers data exploration and visualization functionality in Watson Studio.\n",
    "Model building can be done using a service. One example of a service is Watson Machine Learning. Watson Machine Learning can train and build models using various open-source libraries. Google has a similar service on their cloud called AI Platform Training. Every cloud provider has a solution for this task. SPSS Modeler supports exporting models as Predictive Model Markup Language (PMML), which other commercial and open software packages can read. In addition, Watson Machine Learning deploys a model and makes it available to consumers using a REST interface. Amazon SageMaker Model Monitor is an example of a cloud tool to monitor deployed machine learning and deep learning models continuously. Every major cloud provider has similar tooling. Another tool for model monitoring is Watson OpenScale. \n"
